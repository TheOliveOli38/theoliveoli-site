# About Me!
## Who am I, anyway?
Hey, I'm TheOliveOli, or just Oli. I'm a random lad making silly Mario Kart videos on the Internet.
I'm not just interested in Mario related things, but also in technology. Besides making videos, I also try and do a little programming in my free time. I work on this website, and I try and do games in Unity.

## My interests!
### Video games
My favorite Mario Kart game is 8 Deluxe, of course, with Mario Kart Double Dash, Wii and 7 being other games I played the most and I really liked.
My favorite Mario Platformer meanwhile has to be the Mario Galaxy series, and I don't think there's much more to say, these games were just perfect, from the controls to the soundtrack, atmosphere and level design.
But I'm also into Sonic games! I'm more of a modern Sonic kinda guy though. My favorite games are Sonic Generations, Sonic Adventure and Sonic Mania!
Other games I play are Aurascope, Forza Horizon 4, Portal 2, Mario Kart Tour and more.
### Computer hardware & programming
PC Hardware and operating systems are where I shine the most, even though I tend to hop between operating systems faily often, for various reasons. In terms of programming, I'm honestly not that great, although I'm trying to get better and better every time I work on something.
Some of the stuff I made include: A few scrapped Unity games, this website and a silly little tax calculation program I made for a school project.
### Music
My music taste is kinda basic: I'm mostly into stuff you'd hear on the radio (so Pop and Dance genres) and video game OST.

**Favorite songs:**
- Beat Of Your Heart - Purple Disco Machine
- Walk With Me - Felix Jaehn
- LoveDrug - Lady Gaga
- All My Life - Purple Disco Machine
- Something On My Mind - Purple Disco Machine

**Favorite video game music tracks:**
- Rooftop Run (Act 1), Sonic Generations
- Rooftop Run (Daytime), Sonic Unleashed
- Starstone Forest (Area 2), Aurascope
- Speed Highway (Act 1), Sonic Generations
- Windmill Isle (Daytime), Sonic Unleashed
- Big Blue, Mario Kart 8 (Deluxe)
