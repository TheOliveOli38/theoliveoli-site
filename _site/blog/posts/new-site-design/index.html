<h2>New site design!</h2>
<p>The big Mario Kart Wii UI is gone, and in it's place is a new Windows 7 style, made with 7.css. The biggest improvement with this new design is better navigation, being implemented as text files you can click, as well as the inclusion of tabs to reduce subpages. Originally, I wanted to implement navigation on the old website design, but that would've felt kinda out-of-place. The other big improvement is how well it now scales to different screen resolutions and window sizes. While my previous website was only really optimized for 1366x768 and 1920x1080, you can now get a pretty fine experience on phones too with this new design. Obviously, it isn't perfect, but it makes the site somewhat usable on mobile now.</p>
