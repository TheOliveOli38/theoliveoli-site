<h2>Site moved to Blahaj Land!</h2>
<p>Blahaj Land's really cool. As you might know, my site was previously was on Neocities. I randomly stumbled upon Blahaj Land when I tried to find a link to a Firefox User Style in a Discord server (this is actually true btw). So I decided to give it a try, and I really like it so far; The value you get in the free tier is insane, although this might change when more and more people flock to the site which is understandable. It's not easy to host stuff for many people while having many services at once and being free. A few of the many perks I really like: Faster speeds than Neocities, your own E-Mail and Nextcloud account with 1 gig of cloud storage and a bunch of tools.</p>
<p>Update: My site is also hosted on Nekoweb now, just in case!</p>
