<h2>Blog Thing, now on 11ty!</h2>
<p>Now, you might be asking yourself: Why? Well, the answer is quite simple, actually: It makes my life sooooo much easier! Instead of having to put my posts in an HTML file and having to worry about formatting and stuff, I can just write my thoughts in a stupidly simple Markdown file. The only thing I really have to do besides actually writing the entry is creating a little header, with data like the title, date and description and run 11ty so it can generate it as HTML code. And while it may seem like it doesn't allow me to design complex designs, that actually isn't the case, as I use HTMl templates, in which the actual content from the Markdown files get pasted in when 11ty runs. And even then, I can just straight up add HTML to my markdown files!</p>
<p>By the way, TIL has been moved too, if you haven't seen already. It's now neatly tucked away in a sidebar on the main blogs page.</p>
<p>As for my website as a whole, I will eventually move everything to 11ty with Site v3, which I will make at some point, and even though I could keep the current Windows 7 style, I think I might go for simpler design, and keep the monospace font, too.</p>
