<h2>Cat-themed site hoster Nekoweb went down</h2>
<p>Cloudflare sucks! Nekoweb went 500 (and SSL error) mode for like 15 mins a few hours ago. Very sad. Luckily I wasn't working on my website when that happened (I was busy playing Sonic Unleashed and watching the chaos unfold in the Discord server) and that's why I have both Blahaj Land and Nekoweb, too. If one goes down, use the other! If both go down, then.... uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
