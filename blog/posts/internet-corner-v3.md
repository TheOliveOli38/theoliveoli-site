## Internet Corner v3 is here!
After only 8 days (wow, what a record, i know) I've pushed another big site update. Why did I do this? Because I moved the entire site to 11ty. Which means easier site editing for me, and hopefully a better viewing experience for mobile users, too.

While the design is currently quite simple, I plan to add some stuff to make it a little more exciting. Maybe I'll add a few more accent color touches here and there.
