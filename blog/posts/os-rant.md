# A rant about operating systems
I'll say it right off the bat, I use Windows, macOS and Android. However, this doesn't really mean that I'm biased toward any one of them, rather that these fit my current needs and preferences the best. Because, and this is something not everyone understands, every OS has it's own set of issues, and when picking an OS, you're most likely just picking the least worst option for the things you care about.

## Windows
The world's most popular OS definitely is not without it's own set of isses, but I guess everyone just lives with those. Well, at least we don't have to deal with Windows 9x and the DOS base anymore.

### Stability
Speaking of. Windows has always been well-known for its blue screen of death, the error screen that shows relevant crash information that's been a part of the OS since the early 90s, to the point where Apple is currently using it to market its Mac computers to those being affected by Windows 10's end of life.\
Not only are crashes fairly frequent under Windows, but so are various other OS-related issues that build up over time, leading to people either ending up with a very slow and broken Windows install, or reinstalling the OS every few months.

### OS-level nag
Microsoft has very much become a service company now. Even Windows and Office are now being distributed "as a service". And that obviously comes with Microsoft trying to push its services onto users, with Microsoft Accounts, Office, OneDrive, Edge and privacy toggles.

### Price
Windows is expensive, and it always has been. Windows 11 Home currently sits at around 100 bucks, and Pro is around 130. Considering how your license is tied to your specific system configuration, upgrading your PC for example would lead you to losing that license, if you don't have it digitally tied to your Microsoft Account.

### Solutions
You can't really fix Windows' stability problem, unless Microsoft decides to move off of the NT Kernel base completely or give that a major rewrite. As for the nag, you can either install the Enterprise IoT LTSC version of Windows 11, or go through the settings to disable every setting you can find, including various notifications if they pop up.\
You can actually kind of circumvent the high price tag of Windows, too. And no, not only through cheap key sites. You can also get any Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 key you already have and use those for activation, or just go the route of none or unauthorized activation.
