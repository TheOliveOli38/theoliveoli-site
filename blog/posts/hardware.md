# My Hardware
I've got a few pieces of hardware at my disposal. While most of them are quite old, they're still pretty fine!

## My most capable machine - Desktop PC
Calling this capable is kind of an overexaggeration, to be honest. It's got a pretty old 240W power supply and case I salvaged from a late 2000s office PC, as well as an 11 year old 4th Gen Intel Core i5 and a GeForce GTX 750 Ti that's just as old.

Despite the obviously dated hardware, its still quite usable for the stuff I do. Except for DaVinci Resolve. Lag is very much guaranteed there.

## My daily driver laptop - Dell Latitude 5480
It's a pretty okay machine, even though it's also slowly reaching the 10 year mark. (wow, 2017 was 8 years ago already??? What the heck!?)

Despite not liking Windows at all and having tried a Hackintosh setup a few times, it's currently running Windows 10. Unfortunately, Linux is currently a no-go due to me having to use MS Office.

## The phone - Samsung Galaxy S10
Got it recently after having ditched a 2016 iPhone SE. It's an overseas model (from the US, so it has a Snapdragon 855 chip) I got used, in very good condition with just minor scratches on the screen.

If it weren't for the now slowly obsolete Android 12 with One UI 4.1, I'd honestly consider continuing to use it for more than 3 years from now, as the hardware is still quite good, and can handle everything I throw at it.

## The headphones
I use them pretty much every day. Those are Sony headphones I got on a discount for 30 bucks. Insane battery life for an incredibly short charge time, and the audio quality is good for my standards.

So uhhhh yeah, this is the stuff I get to use on a daily basis. Despite their age, they still do everything I would want to do.
