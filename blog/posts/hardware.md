# My Hardware
I've got a few pieces of hardware at my disposal. While most of them are quite old, they're still pretty fine!

## My most capable machine - Desktop PC
Calling this capable is kind of an overexaggeration, to be honest. It's got a pretty old 240W power supply and case I salvaged from a late 2000s office PC, as well as an 11 year old 4th Gen Intel Core i5-4670K and a GeForce GTX 750 Ti that's just as old.

Despite the obviously dated hardware, its still quite usable for the stuff I do. Except for DaVinci Resolve. Lag is very much guaranteed there.

## My daily driver laptop - Dell Latitude E5470
It's a pretty okay machine, though it's also very much showing it's age (10 years old) with it's i5-6300U and an Intel HD 520.

I recently upgraded its screen to a 1080p panel from the original 1366x768 screen. While battery life has taken a huge hit, it's a fine tradeoff for the way better screen quality I get.

It's currently running macOS Catalina, as I do not like using Windows on laptops anymore ever since first trying out macOS. Linux is a no-go for me since I need the Microsoft Office desktop apps.

## The phone - Samsung Galaxy S10
Got it recently after having ditched a 2016 iPhone SE. It's an overseas model (from the US, so it has a Snapdragon 855 chip) I got used, in very good condition with just minor scratches on the screen.

If it weren't for the now slowly obsolete Android 12 with One UI 4.1, I'd honestly consider continuing to use it for more than 3 years from now, as the hardware is still quite good, and can handle everything I throw at it. If I could, I'd install LineageOS, but the Snapdragon chip and forced locked bootloader (thanks US carriers!) prevent me from doing so.

## The headphones
I use them pretty much every day. Those are Sony headphones I got on a discount for 30 bucks. Insane battery life for an incredibly short charge time, and the audio quality is good for my standards.

So uhhhh yeah, this is the stuff I get to use on a daily basis. Despite their age, they still do everything I would want to do.
