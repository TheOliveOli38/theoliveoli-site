# Hardware!
I've got a few pieces of hardware at my disposal. Not many are good, most are pretty freaking bad.

## My most capable machine - Desktop PC
Calling this capable is kind of an overexaggeration, to be honest. It's got an old ass 240W power supply and case I salvaged from a late 2000s office PC, as well as an almost 11 year old 4th Gen Intel Core i5 and an 11 year old GeForce GTX 750 Ti.

Despite the obviously dated hardware, its still quite usable for the stuff I do. Except for DaVinci Resolve. That shit lags really badly on it.

## My daily driver laptop - Dell Latitude 5480
Got it a few months ago from writing this, and it's a pretty okay machine, even though it's also slowly reaching the 10 year mark. (wow, 2017 was 8 years ago already??? What the heck!?)

I could not and still cannot stand Windows on laptops, so it's running macOS. I had given Windows another chance 2 weeks ago as I was making my TaxCalc program (which needs Visual Studio, which is only for Windows) and it had left me even more disappointed. I got daily bluescreens on a fresh install.

Fuck Microsoft, honestly! Dump Copilot and fix your freaking OS instead!

## The shitty phone - iPhone SE 2016
Forced to use this. Barely holds a charge. Gets hot. Runs a buggy and outdated version of iOS.

Has a cracked screen. Dropped it down the stairs, screen popped out. What a joke, my previous 2014 low end Samsung got dropped down the stairs too, and it just got a tiny scratch.

And the back camera got dirty on the inside somehow.

## The even shitter phone - Huawei Y7 2018
Technically not my phone, got it given to me by my friend as he has no use for it anymore. I will have to give it back to him at some point.

Has an even slower CPU than the SE 2016, yet I enjoy using this more than the iPhone, even though it's giant for my hands. I guess I like Android that much, huh?

## The headphones
I wouldn't have put this here like a week ago, but I've been using it daily now. Those are Sony headphones I got on a discount for 30 bucks. Insane battery life for an incredibly short charge time.

So uhhhh yeah, this is the stuff I get to use on a daily basis. Not great, but I've gotten used to it.
