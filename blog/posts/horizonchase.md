# The Horizon Chase Experience
First up, some background info. Horizon Chase was originally released for both Android and iOS in 2015 and is an arcade racer, inspired by late 80s/early 90s 2D racing games, and it was developed by a Brazilian game studio (Aquiris) which seems to have been acquired by Epic Games now. In 2018 Aquiris released a port of Horizon Chase called Horizon Chase Turbo on Windows, Linux, macOS and the Switch, PS4, Xbox One and a limited PSVita release in 2021.

## So, how's the gameplay?
As already mentioned, Horizon Chase plays like most 2D racing games released on consoles like the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis and more. And while you'd think that'd make it a lot more boring that other racing games, I'd actually argue against that. While it obviously isn't as realistic or detailed as Gran Turismo and Forza, it's still quite a lot of fun, especially with mechanics like Nitro, fuel and collectable tokens.
